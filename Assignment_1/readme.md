# Assignment 1:
Solving the 1D Heat conduction equation using `FTCS` ( Forward difference in time and Central difference in Space ) scheme
## Problem Definition :
1. Initial Condition : Temperature of the wire is 0 degC
2. Boundary Conditions:
    * T(x=0m) = 1 degC
    * T(x=Lm) = 0 degC
3. Time period for solving : t = 0s to t = 10s
4. The following time steps are to be used for solving :
    * dt = 0.1
    * dt = 0.01
    * dt = 0.001
