# AM5630_Foundations_of_CFD_Assignments
Assignment submission for the course Foundation of Computational Fluid Dynamics (AM5630) in the Spring 2021 Semester, under Prof. K Arul Prakash.

## Description of Assignments
#### `Assignment 1` : 
  * Solving the 1D Heat equation using FTCS scheme for :
      * Different _time steps_.
      * Different _thermal diffusivities_. 
  * The inferences drawn from the experiments with different time steps are documented in the `report` submitted.
#### `Assignment 2` : 
  * Solving the 2D Transient Heat equation using :
      * FTCS method
      * ADI method
  * Solving the 2D Steady State Heat equation using :
      * Point Gauss Seidal method
      * Line Gauss Seidal method
      * PSOR method
      * LSOR method
      * ADI method
  * The effect of symmetry on solution is studied, and a detailed report containing the inferences is submitted.
### `Assignment 3` :
  * Simulating `Lid-Driven Cavity flow` problem by solving Navier Stokes equation using `Stream function Vorticity approach`
    * The effect of change in grid points and time step is documented in the report.
    * The results of the solution is validated against data provided by `Ghia et al,`.
    * A further investigation is done by simulating the same problem in `Ansys 2021 R1`using `SIMPLE` scheme with similar conditions and the results are documented in the report
